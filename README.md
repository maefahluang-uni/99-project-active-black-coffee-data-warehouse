- Download Features: Download datasets in various formats for analysis and research.  
This feature involves providing users with the ability to download datasets in different file formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel, API) for further analysis and research. While the frontend may provide the interface for users to initiate and customize download requests, the actual generation and delivery of dataset files typically occur on the backend. The backend is responsible for handling file generation and serving the files to users for download.

- Administrator Database Management
