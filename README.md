# FrontEnd
- UI Display website.      
- Dataset Catalog: Browse and search through a catalog of available datasets.  
This feature involves presenting datasets to users in a structured and searchable manner. It includes displaying dataset metadata, allowing users to browse through available datasets, and providing search functionality. This functionality is typically implemented in the front-end, as it deals with the user interface and interaction.
- Data Visualization: Visualize datasets using an interactive table similar to Excel.  
This feature involves presenting datasets in a visual format, such as charts and tables, to help users understand the data better. It includes creating interactive charts, graphs, and tables that allow users to explore the data visually. This functionality is also implemented in the front-end, as it directly affects how data is presented to users and interacts with their input.
