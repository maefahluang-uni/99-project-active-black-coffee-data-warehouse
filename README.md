# MFU Data Warehouse

The university generates a lot of data to efficiently manage operations across various organizations. However, this data is dispersed among organizations, leading to usage restrictions. \
  \
  To address this, the Information Technology Service Center and Information Management Unit plan to develop a Data Warehouse to support campus operations and manage large amounts of data, enhancing the university’s overall presentation. Data warehousing technology has enabled companies to organize and store large volumes of business data in a form that can be analyzed. Those who assume the role of being responsible for the data warehouse a data engineers based on the idea that The concept of near-real-time data warehousing is a step towards minimizing the data latency in making user data available in the data warehouse for analysis. Moreover, would need a faster transaction and operations data system. With the large-scale development of pipeline engineering and other complex projects requiring extensive data management, the need for an efficient and effective data warehouse solution is crucial. On the other hand, some of the negative consequences of not implementing a data warehouse include malfunctioning systems, operational inefficiency, ineffective business analysis, and delayed availability of timely data. This can lead to a decrease in customer satisfaction, damage to the company’s reputation, and hinder strategic decision-making. Nevertheless, the goal is to collect and integrate data from multiple sources within the university. \
  \
  Consequently, the Data Warehouse project at Mae Fah Luang University is an undertaking to create a centralized repository that will store and manage various types of data relevant to the university.
