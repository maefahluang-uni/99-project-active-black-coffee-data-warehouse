# MFU Data Warehouse

Due to the current work of Mae Fah Luang University, a great deal of data has been created and collected, causing information in the university to be scattered in each department, which does not have a clear central source of information. The operation requires a long period of time and the management of various information systems that have a large amount of data in various formats creates limitations in use. Therefore, the Information Technology Service Center and the Information Management Unit of Mae Fah Luang University have The intention is to develop a central source of information to manage large volumes of data in the future and to enhance the university's ability to present information more effectively.
Mae Fah Luang University is a leading educational institution in Thailand, known for its commitment to excellence in teaching, research, and community engagement. The university generates a vast amount of data across various disciplines and departments, including research outputs. This data holds immense potential for analysis, decision-making, and improving the overall functioning of the university. However, currently, there is no centralized platform where this data is made available to the public or even within the university itself. The lack of a centralized and accessible data platform hinders the university's ability to harness the full potential of its data.
